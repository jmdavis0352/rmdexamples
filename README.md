The **rmdexamples** package illustrates various techniques for extending [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The examples included here are described in more detail in the article on [Shiny Widgets](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny_widgets.html).

To try out rmdexamples locally, you should first install the **remotes** package, then:

```r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
# you may also need to update packages: update.packages(ask = FALSE)
remotes::install_github("rstudio/rmdexamples")
```
